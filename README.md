# Final Project: IBM Data Science Professional Certificate  
**SpaceX Data Analysis & Prediction**

## Overview  
This repository contains my final project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The project focuses on collecting, analyzing, and predicting SpaceX launch data. It demonstrates a full data science workflowâ€”from data collection via API and web scraping, through data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA) (using both Python and SQL), to predictive modeling and interactive visualization with a Plotly Dash app.

## Project Workflow

- **Data Collection:**  
  Utilizes API requests and web scraping to gather SpaceX launch data.

- **Data Wrangling:**  
  Cleans and prepares the data for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Performs analysis using both Python visualizations and SQL queries to uncover trends and insights.

- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  Applies machine learning techniques to forecast outcomes based on historical data.

- **Interactive Visualization:**  
  Features an interactive dashboard (built with Plotly Dash) for exploring the data and results.
